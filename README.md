Red Black Tree

A red black binary search tree,  offering better worst case time complexity than most other binary search trees.

Like many other binary search trees it has an expected time O(log n) for many operations like inserting, deleting, and searching. 
Unlike many other tree types, though, it also has a worst case time of O(log n) on these operations, rather than the common O(n) worst time.
